# Rust Finland

Welcome to *Rust Finland*, a group of programmers enthusiastic about
[Rust][1], the blazingly fast and safe systems programming language developed
by Mozilla.

## Participate

### Meetups

Join the [Finland Rust-lang Group][2] Meetup group and come to our meetups. We
try to host meetups regularly with a variety of topics ranging from basic to
advanced topics.

No worries if you have no Rust experience or are just starting out. We welcome
folks from all experience and interest levels.

### Chat

Chat with us on the [#rust-finland:matrix.org][3] channel. We talk news, Rust
features, ask questions, and help out others.

### GitHub

Check out our Github repositories under the [rust-finland][4] organization.

Currently we only have this website in there, but hopefully soon we can start
creating repositories for other community projects and efforts.

## Share the word

There could be hundreds if not thousands of people in Finland who are interested
in Rust or maybe even work with it daily. The Rust Finland community is always
open for new members.

By sharing this website, our meetup page, our repositories, or perhaps just
mentioning us in a tweet you're helping people connect and network. The more
the merrier!
