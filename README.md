# Rust Finland website

This is the website of the *Rust Finland* community. It is a static website
powered by [Gutenberg][3], a static site generator written in Rust.

## Contributing

### Contributing changes to the website code and content

First install Gutenberg. You can get release binaries from the Gutenberg GitHub
repository's release tab.

Next, fork this repository and clone the fork to your local machine.

After cloning you can start a development server with hot reload by using

    $ cd rust-finland.org
    $ gutenberg serve

This development server live-compiles the site while you're working.

Once you're done making changes or adding content, push back to your fork at
GitHub and create a new Pull Request.
